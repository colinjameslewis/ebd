To the extent that any service of EBD used by you has terms and conditions that conflict with the terms herein, the terms and conditions of such service shall take precedence with respect to such contradictory terms.  
		<p>By accessing or using the Online Services, you agree to the following Terms.  You should review these Terms regularly as they may change at any time at the sole discretion of EBD.  If you do not agree to any portion of these Terms, you should not access or otherwise use the Online Services.  “Content” refers to any text, tool, material, document, image, graphic, logo, design, audio, video and any other information provided from or on, uploaded to and/or downloaded from the Online Services.</p>

		<p>We will make an effort to update this web page with any changes to these Terms and/or to the services described in these Terms and you are encouraged to review these Terms frequently (the date of the most recent revision to these Terms appear at the end of these Terms).</p>

Accordingly, your UserID, password, User Account information and transmitted information are encrypted using an SSL connection and are not expected to be read in an intelligible form as they travel to the Online Services.  You, however, are ultimately responsible for protecting your UserID, password, User Account information and payment information from disclosure to third parties, and you are not permitted to circumvent the use of required encryption technologies.  You agree to (i) immediately notify EBD of any unauthorized use of your UserID, password or User Account, or any other breach of security, and (ii) ensure that you exit from your User Account at the end of each session.
