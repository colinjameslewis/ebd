She comes by way of both New York City and San Diego, with a brief stop at the Pennsylvania State University to earn her BA in psychology, to produce an undergraduate thesis in the honors program on the science of hypnosis, and to get elected to Phi Beta Kappa.</p>

<p>After an introduction to the health insurance industry at Scripps Clinic in La Jolla, she worked several years at the Child Guidance Clinic as Head of Intake, Research Assistant to the Chief of Psychology, and Manager of the Residency Training Program for the University of California at San Diego. She returned to the east coast to start a family and pursue her interest in yoga through practice, teaching, and research. Judy taught yoga at many of the adult school programs in the Philadelphia tri-county area, Garland of Letters, the Fitness Factory, Riverside Racket & Fitness, Temple University, and the Ben Franklin Clinic where she participated in Dean Ornish's research exploring the effects of yoga on patients with heart disease. While working for SKY Foundation and the Yoga Research Society, she helped produce an array of conferences and concerts featuring doctors, scientists, authors, and celebrities who were proponents of alternative health and eastern philosophy.</p>

<p>Judy went on to manage Ahava, a boutique in Manayunk, PA, and several healthcare practices in the fields of psychology, orthopedics, and ophthalmology. She took on each practice as if it were her own and each thrived under her careful supervision and adept choices of talented personnel. For eight years, Expert Business Development has brought new challenges to Judy's life as she ventured outside of the healthcare arena.  She approaches her work with enthusiasm and care for the agents that work under her supervision and the clients who are serviced.</p>

<p>Captivated by community theater, you can catch Judy and her husband, Richard, reveling in many musical performances, either participating in the chorus or taking on lead roles in productions of The Music Man, Bye Bye Birdie, How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, Fiddler on the Roof, Pirates of Penzance, Hello Dolly, The Pajama Game, Joseph & the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, and, most recently, The Wizard of Oz. She is a team player all the way and aims to satisfy her audiences, whether on stage or in the virtual office of her business environment.</p>"
