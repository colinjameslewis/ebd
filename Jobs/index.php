			<p class="jobs-info"><b>	EBD is the nation's premier provider of outsourced business development services to banks and financial institutions</b>. Our bank clients range from community and regional banks with assets less than $100 million to strong national and international banks with assets in excess of $400 billion. Our non-bank clients are similarly diverse. EBDâ€™s greatest accomplishment is helping so many companies truly embrace the concept of building relationships rather than simply selling products and services. </br></br>
			
			<b>	As a boutique business development firm, we believe in the entrepreneurial spirit and practice the art of <a>Respectful Persistence</a></b>. We build professional relationships based on commitment to shared values of persistence, resiliency, and attention to client needs. If you have a passion for helping other businesses grow and prosper, you may be a good fit for our team.

				<p>Our Business Development Agents are NOT telemarketers. We are seeking mature, experienced professionals that have an entrepreneurial spirit. Many of our agents have been with our company since we started 20 years ago and come from the ranks of business owners, sales and IT professionals, bankers, insurance agents, recruiters and the like. </br></br>
				
				A candidate for this position must enjoy working on the phone and must be able to handle some rejection. Training is provided with a lot of support, however, you must have a strong sales or an appointment setting background, preferably B2B. It is necessary to be experienced and comfortable working with high level executives.</br></br>
				
				<b>You will be working as an independent contractor from your home office.</b> We hire people from all over the U.S., Canada and the U.K.<span class="exit read-more-toggler glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></span>
